# WooCommerce POS Competitive Analysis
## Pricing, Market Share & Subsegment Breakdown

**Date:** February 19, 2026

---

## Market Context

- **WooCommerce powers ~4.5–6.5M active stores globally** (varies by source)
- **WooCommerce POS extensions connect ~80,000 retail outlets** ([MarketingLTB](https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/woocommerce-statistics/))
- **~10% of WooCommerce stores with physical locations use POS extensions** ([MarketingLTB](https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/woocommerce-statistics/))
- **Zero competitors offer a native Android app running on the Stripe S700**

The total addressable market for WooCommerce POS is therefore roughly 80,000–100,000 active retail locations today, with the broader opportunity being any of the 4.5M+ WooCommerce stores that could add in-person selling.

## Fee Comparison Matrix

| Solution | Monthly Subscription | Annual Cost | Platform/Tx Fee | Stripe In-Person Rate | Total Cost on $10K/mo Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OneTill (us)** | TBD | TBD | TBD | 2.7% + $0.05 | TBD |
| **Jovvie** | $19–$49/mo | $228–$588/yr | **0.5–2.5% platform fee** | 2.7% + $0.05 | ~$278–$838/yr + $600–$3,000 platform fees |
| **Oliver POS** | $0–$39.99/mo | $0–$480/yr | None | 2.7% + $0.05 | $0–$480/yr + $3,300 Stripe fees |
| **FooSales** | $15–$25/mo | $180–$300/yr | None | 2.7% + $0.05 | $180–$300/yr + $3,300 Stripe fees |
| **WCPOS** | $0 (free) / $129 one-time | $0–$129 | None | 2.7% + $0.05 | $0–$129 + $3,300 Stripe fees |
| **Square for WooCommerce** | $0 (free POS) | $0 | N/A (Square is the processor) | **2.6% + $0.10** | $3,120 Square processing fees |
| **Webkul** | N/A | $99/yr (+$99 for Stripe add-on) | None | 2.7% + $0.05 | $99–$198/yr + $3,300 Stripe fees |
| **Openpos** | N/A | $64/yr | None | 2.7% + $0.05 | $64/yr + $3,300 Stripe fees |
| **ConnectPOS** | $49–$99/mo | $588–$1,188/yr | None | Varies by gateway | $588–$1,188/yr + processing fees |
| **YITH POS** | N/A | €179.99/yr (~$195) | None | **No card reader support** | $195/yr (cash only) |
| **Hike POS** | $59–$69/mo | $708–$828/yr | None | Varies | $708–$828/yr + processing fees |

**Note:** Stripe Terminal charges merchants **2.7% + $0.05 per in-person transaction** universally. This is Stripe's fee, not the POS provider's fee. Jovvie is the only WooCommerce POS that adds their own platform fee (0.5–2.5%) on top of Stripe's fee, which is significant.

Oliver POS         ████████████████████           ~20-25%
FooSales           ████████████████               ~15-20%
WCPOS              ████████████                   ~10-15%
Square for Woo     ████████████                   ~10-15%

ConnectPOS         ████                           ~3-5%
YITH POS           ████                           ~3-5%
Hike POS           ███                            ~2-3%

**Important caveat:** These are estimates. No reliable third-party market share data exists for WooCommerce POS plugins specifically. Estimates are based on: WordPress.org active installs, CodeCanyon sales figures, review volumes across Capterra/G2/Trustpilot, and relative visibility in community discussions and comparison articles.

## Strategic Implications for OneTill

### Pricing Opportunity
The market clusters into three tiers:
1. **Budget tier** ($0–$99/yr): WCPOS (free), Openpos ($64), Webkul ($99) — weak support, buggy, limited
2. **Mid tier** ($180–$480/yr): FooSales, Oliver, Jovvie Basic, YITH — functional but no S700 native
3. **Premium tier** ($588–$1,188/yr): ConnectPOS, Hike, Jovvie Premium — expensive, not WooCommerce-native

**Our opportunity:** Price at the mid tier ($15–$29/mo) but deliver a premium experience via the native S700 advantage. The single-device proposition eliminates hardware costs merchants currently pay (tablet + stand + reader = $350–$600), making our total cost of ownership competitive even at a higher subscription price.

### Jovvie Is Our Primary Competitor
Jovvie is the most dangerous competitor because they're an official Stripe Partner, they target the same subsegments (pop-ups, markets, retail), and they have the deepest Stripe Terminal integration. However:
- They charge a **platform fee** (0.5–2.5%) on top of Stripe — merchants hate this
- They **don't run natively on S700** — their "S700 support" is browser-based
- Their cloud dependency means **no true offline mode**

### No One Owns the S700
The single most important finding: **zero competitors have a native Android app for the Stripe S700**. This isn't a feature gap — it's a structural moat. Building for the S700 requires Android development expertise, Stripe Apps on Devices approval, and understanding of the S700's constraints (no Google Play Services, 200MB APK limit, daily midnight restarts). None of the current players have invested in this.

### ConnectPOS Is a Cautionary Tale
ConnectPOS looks great on paper (multi-platform, award-winning, 24/7 support) but has devastating Capterra reviews calling it "a scam company" with non-functional WooCommerce integration. This tells us: **don't overpromise, and WooCommerce integration quality is table stakes**.

### The Support Gap Is Real
WCPOS (single dev, no support), wePOS (abandoned), ConnectPOS (non-functional) — the bar for support is on the floor. AI-powered support is a genuine competitive advantage here, not a gimmick.
